# Notes on "CUDA by Example" by Jason Sanders and Edward Kandrot

"CUDA by Example" is a book by Jason Sanders and Edward Kandrot, explaining how to learn the fundamentals of programming NVidia GPUs using CUDA. The homepage for the book is [here](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-example), from which all of the source code for from the book can be downloaded (I found that for some reason I couldn't download the source code using the Google Chrome web browser, but I was able to download the source code using the Microsoft Edge web broswer). All of the code from the book can be compiled and run on a GPU such as a [Jetson Nano Developer Kit](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/jetson-nano-developer-kit) (although note that some examples require additional compiler flags, EG `-lGL -lGLU -lglut` for the Julia examples from chapter 4 of the book). Before starting, make sure that `nvcc` is present on your system path (on a freshly set up Jetson Nano Developer Kit, this involves appending `PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/cuda-10.2/bin/` to the end of `~/.bashrc`; apart from this, a freshly set up Jetson Nano Developer Kit supports everything required for `ssh`, `rsync`, X11 forwarding to view graphical interfaces over `ssh`).
