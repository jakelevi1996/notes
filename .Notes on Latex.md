## Installation

Two major distributions of Latex are [TeX Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/) and [MiKTeX](https://miktex.org/download). [Overleaf appears to suggest MiKTeX for Windows](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Choosing_a_LaTeX_Compiler#TeX_distributions), however [this Stack Overflow answer states that MiKTeX is susceptible to simple viruses](https://tex.stackexchange.com/a/20415/266921), and TeX Live is also [strongly recommended](https://github.com/James-Yu/LaTeX-Workshop/wiki/Install#requirements) by the [Visual Studio Code LaTeX Workshop Extension](https://github.com/James-Yu/LaTeX-Workshop) (which I am using to automate compiling LaTeX documents into PDF), so I decided to go with TeX Live, which can be downloaded from [here](https://www.tug.org/texlive/).

## Math formatting

### Underset text

To make text appear underneath an operator, use `\underset`, as in `$\underset{1 \leq j \leq n}{\max}$` (requires `amsmath` package, [source](https://tex.stackexchange.com/a/40217/266921)), EG:

![](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\underset{1&space;\leq&space;j&space;\leq&space;n}{\max}\left[&space;\frac{x_j}{y_j}&space;\right])
