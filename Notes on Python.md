### `socket`

These notes are mostly made from the [Socket Programming in Python (Guide)](https://realpython.com/python-sockets/) on [realpython.com](https://realpython.com/). See also the [Python documentation for the `socket` module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/socket.html).

- Sockets can be used to communicate between different processes on a single PC, or different PCs connected over a network
- Sockets "originated with ARPANET in 1971 and later became an API in the Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) operating system released in 1983 called Berkeley sockets"
- "All modern operating systems implement a version of the Berkeley socket interface. It became the standard interface for applications running in the Internet" ([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_sockets))
- "The most common type of socket applications are client-server applications, where one side acts as the server and waits for connections from clients"
- After importing the `socket` module using `import socket`, a socket can be created using the [`socket.socket`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/socket.html#socket.socket) class, EG `s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)`
  - The first argument to `socket.socket` is `family`, which represents the "address (and protocol) families", and can be EG `socket.AF_INET` or `socket.AF_INET6`
    - `socket.AF_INET` represents the [Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4) **A**ddress **F**amily
    - `socket.AF_INET6` can be used for IPv6
  - The second argument to `socket.socket` is `type`, which represents the "socket types", and can be EG `socket.SOCK_STREAM` or `socket.SOCK_DGRAM`
    - `socket.SOCK_STREAM` specifies that the default protocol used by the socket is the [Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol), which is reliable (packets dropped in the network are detected and retransmitted by the sender) and has in-order data delivery (data is read by your application in the order it was written by the sender)
    - `socket.SOCK_DGRAM` can be used to specify User Datagram Protocol (UDP) sockets, which arenâ€™t reliable, and can deliver data in a different order from that which was sent
