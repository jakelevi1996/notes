## Tips

- To view HTML of a website in Chrome, right-click and select "View page source", or use shortcut `ctrl+u`
- When developing in VS Code, use extension "Live Preview" by Microsoft (Extension ID = `ms-vscode.live-server`) to view HTML changes as they're made

## Getting started

This is how I got started:

- I wanted to create a [personal/academic website](https://jakelevi1996.github.io/)
- I original forked [`academicpages.github.io`](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) but found this had way more code than seemed necessary
- I asked ChatGPT the following questions:
  - I want to make a github.io website. I want the code to be as minimal as possible, including a title, an image, some text, a subtitle, some more text. Here is a template in Markdown: `...` How do I make this into a github.io website with the least amount of code?
  - Are there requirements on the path of `example_image.png`? Does it need to be at the top level of the repository? What if it is in a subdirectory called `img` ??
  - Why is there `<head>` and `<body>` sections?
  - How do I change the font, font colour, and background colour?
  - If I'm developing locally, how do I change HTML settings (EG `padding, max-width` etc) and view the effect of those changes without having to commit and push the changes to github?
  - Any advice about choosing nice colours for text and background?
  - How do I include an email address link that opens as a mailto?
  - What are some nice widely supported fixed width fonts for HTML?
  - Should I describe font, colours etc in a separate CSS file? How would I do that?
  - This HTML image is too big, how do I make it smaller, in a way that will look good on desktop and mobile?
  - How do I centre the title?
